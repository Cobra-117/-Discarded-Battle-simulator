# Battle-simulator
 [Work in progress] This game will be a battle simulator where two teams of fighters will fight each other

#The developpement of this game is actually in progress

##current features:
-Figthers with simple 3d models and animations
-Figthers from one team fight those from the other team

##potential features:
-Sound and music

Please note that I made all 3d models and textures myself
